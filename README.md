This repository contains a list of projects I have worked on in relation to cyber-security. The Ansible folder contains various YAML files that were used to
construct virtual machines showed in the network topology diagrams. Under the Diagram folder you'll find network diagrams of before and after the ELK Stack
build. In the Images folder I've included screenshots pertaining to my "Elk Stack README" file. Last but not least is the Linux folder where previous 
assignments are stored showcasing other bash scripts and files learned in prior studies.
